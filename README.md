# Predicting-the-Strength-of-high-performance-concrete
Featurization, Model Selection &amp; Tuning
This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

Data Description:
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a
specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not
scaled). The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output
variable, and 1030 instances (observations).
Domain:
Cement manufacturing
Context:
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete
compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.
These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water,
superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
Attribute Information:
 Cement : measured in kg in a m3 mixture
 Blast : measured in kg in a m3 mixture
 Fly ash : measured in kg in a m3 mixture
 Water : measured in kg in a m3 mixture
 Superplasticizer : measured in kg in a m3 mixture
 Coarse Aggregate : measured in kg in a m3 mixture
 Fine Aggregate : measured in kg in a m3 mixture
 Age : day (1~365)
 Concrete compressive strength measured in MPa
